\f0\fs24 \cf0 A branch is an environment in which you can edit snapshots of files without affecting those original files. Later, when you\'92re positive that the changes you\'92ve made are what you need them to be, you can add the changes you\'92ve made in the branch to the original files. This is called merging. It\'92s useful for trying out new ideas without the risk of messing up your original files.}
